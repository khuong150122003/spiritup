This project was developed for the "Social Business Creation" contest to build a comprehensive web application focused on online learning and coaching. The platform is designed to provide users with access to specialized courses, one-on-one coaching, and support from an advisory board, all within a secure and user-friendly environment.

Built using the Laravel framework, the platform offers a robust and scalable solution for delivering educational content and personalized coaching services. The application includes a variety of features tailored to enhance the learning experience and facilitate effective communication between learners and instructors.

Key Features:
User Authentication: A secure login and registration system are used to manage user access.
Specialized Video Courses: A collection of video lessons tailored to specific fields of study, allowing users to learn at their own pace.
1-on-1 Coaching: Personalized coaching sessions to provide targeted support and guidance to learners.
Advisory Board: Access to a board of experts who offer advice and mentorship to users as they progress through their courses.
Responsive Design: Ensures that the platform is accessible on all devices, offering a seamless user experience.
